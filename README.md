Llamarita's Taco Adventure

-Pygame group project

In this game, Llama is HUNGRY for tacos. I mean, who DOESN'T love Mexican food? While hunting tacos, Llama can also enjoy a margarita or two...or three. The sole purpose of your day in the desert is to eat as many tacos as you can while trying to get to 15 margaritas(WOAH!)! But, as you drink margaritas, more cacti come for ya (that happens when I drink 15 margaritas too). So, the Llama should try to avoid any cacti that come it's way.  The cacti will take away your Llama strength.

Be the Llama. Be HUNGRY. Eat tacos. Drink margaritas.
